# Image-Segmenter Used For Concealed Weapons
Segmentation is performed by first performing adaptive thresholding using Minimizing Within-Group Variance technique 
Then in the second step masking is performed to segment the gun from the image

Note: To apply this technique to different images a particular mask image is required based on the image
